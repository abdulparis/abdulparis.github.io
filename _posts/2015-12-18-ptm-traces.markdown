In this post, I just wanted to talk about who I am and what I am doing currently.

My name is Muhammad Abdul WAHAB and I am currently doing a PhD at CentraleSup√©lec (Rennes) financed by CominLabs and Brittany region. I am not going to talk about my PhD subject in today's post. I am planning to do a whole blog post on my PhD subject. 

The subject of today's blog concerns coresight components. What are these components? Why do we need them ? What are the problems that can occur using these components ? What are the limits of these components ?

In order to debug the software, we usually uses software but we can also use hardware. For example, [http://www.arm.com/index.php](ARM) offers the possibility to use the Coresight components (CS) in order to debug the processor(s). Other manufacturers of processors offers hardware solution for debug. For example, Intel offers 

Coresight components [http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0314h/index.html](ARM Coresight Components) offers a multi-core debug and trace solution with high bandwidth for systems. 

They are further divided into three types : 

Coresight Sources : PTM (Program Trace Macrocell), ETM (Embedded Trace Macrocell), ITM (Instrumentation Trace Macrocell) (collect trace from the CPU)

Coresight Links : FUNNEL, REPLICATOR (provides a link between the CS sources and CS sinks)

Coresight Sinks : ETB (Embedded Trace Buffer), TPIU (Trace Port Interface Unit)

The following list is not exhaustive.
